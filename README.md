# TODO-rs 
Simple command line todo utility. This cli tool is useful for quickly adding todos to a folder in your project.
Sometimes, you want to keep track of tasks that are specific to a folder you're working on.
This is the ideal tool if your're frequently leaving todo files in your personal projects, where anything more would be overkill.

# Usage

To create an empty `.todo` file in your directory, simply run:

```bash
todo create
```

Once you have a `.todo` file, you can add entries with:

```bash
> todo add "My first todo"
Added: "My first todo"
```

This will show up as `[ ] My first todo` in the `.todo` file so that you
can manually edit todos quickly and easily understand changes in a commit diff.
Now lets add a second item:

```bash
> todo add "My second todo"
Added: "My second todo"
> todo list
1 [ ] My first todo
2 [ ] My second todo

``` 

I feel like the usafe becomes pretty self explanatory from here. 

```bash
> todo check 1
[x] My first todo
> todo list
1 [ ] My second todo

2 [x] My first todo
> todo remove 1
Removed: [ ] My second todo 
> todo list

1 [ ] My first todo
```

To remove the `.todo` file, simply run `todo destroy` or simply delete the .todo file.

```bash
> todo destroy
Deleted: .todo
```

Simply running `todo` will display a help menu.
